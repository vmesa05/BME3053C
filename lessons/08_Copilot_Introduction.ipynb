    "# What is GitHub Copilot?\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less effort. It works by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suggesting whole lines or blocks of code as you type\n",
    "- Converting comments into working code\n",
    "- Helping you understand and work with unfamiliar libraries\n",
    "- Offering multiple suggestions for you to choose from\n",
    "- Learning from your coding style and preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting Started with Copilot\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access Copilot through GitHub Student Developer Pack**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Sign up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)\n",
    "   - Once approved, activate your free Copilot subscription\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Copilot in Your Development Environment**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - VS Code: Install the \"GitHub Copilot\" extension\n",
    "   - GitHub Codespaces: Copilot is available by default\n",
    "   - JupyterLab: Install the Copilot extension\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify Installation**:\n",
    "   - Look for the Copilot icon in your editor's status bar\n",
    "   - The icon should be active (not grayed out)\n",
    "   - You might need to sign in to GitHub to activate Copilot\n"

    "# Ethics and Responsible Use of GitHub Copilot\n",
    "\n",
    "When using AI-powered coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, it's important to consider several ethical dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Code Ownership and Attribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand the source**: Copilot is trained on public code repositories, which may include copyrighted material\n",
    "- **Review generated code**: Always examine suggestions before accepting them\n",
    "- **Avoid blind copying**: Don't accept code you don't understand or can't explain\n",
    "- **Check licenses**: Be aware that suggested code might be based on code with specific licensing requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Academic Integrity**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Follow institutional policies**: Check your school's guidelines on AI tool usage for assignments\n",
    "- **Transparent usage**: Acknowledge when you've used Copilot for coursework or projects\n",
    "- **Learning vs. automation**: Use Copilot to enhance learning, not replace understanding\n",
    "- **Original thinking**: Ensure you're developing your own problem-solving skills alongside AI assistance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Security and Privacy Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sensitive data**: Never input personal, confidential, or proprietary information into Copilot prompts\n",
    "- **Code review**: AI-generated code may contain security vulnerabilities or bugs\n",
    "- **Data handling**: Be mindful of how Copilot processes your code and comments\n",
    "- **Medical context**: Extra caution needed when building healthcare applications with patient data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Bias and Fairness**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithmic bias**: AI models can perpetuate biases present in training data\n",
    "- **Inclusive design**: Review generated code for accessibility and inclusive practices\n",
    "- **Cultural sensitivity**: Be aware that AI suggestions may not account for diverse perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Best Practices for Ethical Use**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Treat Copilot as a collaborator**, not a replacement for critical thinking\n",
    "2. **Validate all suggestions** through testing and code review\n",
    "3. **Maintain coding skills** - don't become overly dependent on AI assistance\n",
    "4. **Stay informed** about your organization's AI usage policies\n",
    "5. **Consider the impact** of your code on users and society\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Vite React: `npm run build` → outputs `dist/`\n",
    "2. Commit and push all changes.\n",
    "3. Confirm `.gitignore` excludes `node_modules/` but DOES NOT exclude your source.\n",
    "4. (Optional) Add a basic README deployment section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Create / Log Into Netlify\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visit https://www.netlify.com/\n",
    "- Sign up (GitHub login recommended) and authorize access to your repos.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Deploy Manually\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run local build.\n",
    "2. Drag the resulting `build/` or `dist/` folder into the Netlify UI (Sites → Add new site → Deploy manually).\n",
    "3. Use for prototypes; Git integration is better for iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Custom Domains & HTTPS\n",
